## Caesar Cipher
This project encrypt a word and you can decrypt it later.

## Running 
1. ```python main.py```
2. Type 'encode' or 'decode', if type anything else will work as decode. (I didn't create any validation in this project)
3. Type the word, then how much you want to shift. Example: word "abc" if you shift 2 position will become "cde"
4. To decode, the receiver need to know the positions you shifted.
